Module 4 - pandas challenge

Assignment is titled 'main.ipynb' and located inside the "PyCitySchools" folder

Written Analysis is located inside the "PyCitySchools" folder

Pandas .nunique() method located in cell 4, came from: https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_nunique.asp

Some cells were directly copy and pasted from the 'starter code' that came with our assignment resources. Some variables were changed to be more consistent with my work.


After completing this assignment, I'm convinced how much easier it would be to have a live person, whether it be a boss/coworker/client explain what exactly they want. The wording on some of these prompts for the assignment is not the best and is vague. While completing this assignment I am reminded of what my calculus teacher in high school told the class: "The calculus is easy is for you guys, but the algebra is hard." Knowing what tools to use and what we need to do to our data is not what's difficult, it's the actual coding part that is more difficult.
